# HGDL - A Hybrid HPC Optimizer

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/HGDL)](https://pypi.org/project/hgdl/)

The HGDL package is a high-performance, distributed, asynchronous optimizer
that can be used for fvGP and therefore gpCAM training
and the acquisition function optimization.
However, it is its own python API which can be installed via `pip`.

## Installation

```
pip install hgdl
```

## Code and Tests

git clone [https://github.com/lbl-camera/HGDL.git](https://github.com/lbl-camera/HGDL)
